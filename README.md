# OSC Interface

## Overview
The OSC Interface is an open-source tool designed to automate the retrieval of files from Google Drive and distribute them into predetermined locations. This software simplifies managing and organizing files, offering integration with their Google Drive accounts.

## To Use
Simply download the source code, set up your LocalConfig file, and configure the following paths:
- blacklist.txt (folder names to ignore when merging directories)
- file_names.txt (files to import from)
- folder_ids.txt (gfolder id's to retrieve content from)
- folder_names.txt (those gfolder names)
- target_location.txt (where to put the files)

Provided you're actually serious about using this software, please email [contact@kakusui.org](mailto:contact@kakusui.org) to request a client_secrets.json file.

Once this is completed, you can simply run the run.py file and log in through Google, and your transfer will complete.
